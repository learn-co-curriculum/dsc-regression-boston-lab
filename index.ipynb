    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll apply the regression analysis and diagnostics techniques covered in this section to the \"Ames Housing\" dataset. You performed a detailed EDA for this dataset earlier on, and hopefully, you more or less recall how this data is structured! In this lab, you'll use some of the features in this dataset to create a linear model to predict the house price!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Perform a linear regression using statsmodels\n",
    "* Determine if a particular set of data exhibits the assumptions of linear regression\n",
    "* Evaluate a linear regression model by using statistical performance metrics pertaining to overall model and specific parameters\n",
    "* Use the coefficient of determination to determine model performance\n",
    "* Interpret the parameters of a simple linear regression model in relation to what they signify for specific data\n",
